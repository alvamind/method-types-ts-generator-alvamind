Tired of manually writing TypeScript types for your methods? Say no more! `method-types-ts-generator-alvamind` is here to automate that tedious process, saving you time and headaches. This library scans your TypeScript files, extracts method signatures, and generates a ready-to-use `.d.ts` file with all the types for your exposed methods. Whether you're building microservices, complex applications, or anything in between, this tool will boost your productivity and ensure type safety.

## ‚ú® Features & Benefits

*   **Effortless Type Generation:** Automatically creates TypeScript definitions from your code.
*   **Deep Scanning:** Recursively traverses your directories to find all relevant `.ts` files.
*   **Handles Complex Types:** Supports generics, promises, optional parameters, and more!
*   **Customizable Output:** Control where the generated `.d.ts` file is saved.
*   **Clean & Readable Output:** The generated types are formatted for maximum clarity.
*   **Boosts Productivity:** Eliminate the need to manually maintain method types.
*   **Ensures Type Safety:** Catch potential type errors at compile-time, not runtime.
*   **Easy to Use:** Simple CLI interface makes it a breeze to integrate into your projects.
*   **Framework Agnostic:** Works with any TypeScript project.
*   **Open Source & Free:** Contribute to the project and use it without restrictions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
bun add method-types-ts-generator-alvamind
```

or

```bash
npm install method-types-ts-generator-alvamind
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
method-types-ts-generator-alvamind generate <scanPath> <outputPath>
```

*   `<scanPath>`: The path to the directory containing your TypeScript files.
*   `<outputPath>`: The path to where you want the generated `.d.ts` file.

#### Example

Let's say you have a directory `src/services` with a file like `userService.ts`:

```typescript
// src/services/userService.ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

class UserService {
  async getUser(id: number): Promise<User> {
      // Some implementation here
      return { id, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" };
  }

  async createUser(name: string, email:string): Promise<User>{
    // Some implementation here
      return { id: 1, name: name, email: email };
  }

    async updateUser(id:number, user: Partial<User>): Promise<User> {
         // Some implementation here
        return { ...user, id: id} as User
    }
}
```

To generate type definitions, run:

```bash
method-types-ts-generator-alvamind generate ./src/services ./src/generated/exposed-methods.d.ts
```

This will create a file named `exposed-methods.d.ts` in the `src/generated` directory with following content.

```typescript
// Auto-generated by method-types-ts-generator-alvamind

export interface ExposedMethods {
  UserService: {
    getUser(id: number): Promise<User>;
    createUser(name: string, email: string): Promise<User>;
    updateUser(id: number, user: Partial<User>): Promise<User>;
  };
}

```

Now you can import and use these types in your project!

```typescript
import { ExposedMethods } from './src/generated/exposed-methods';

async function main() {
  const userService = {} as ExposedMethods['UserService']

  const user = await userService.getUser(1);
  console.log(user)
}
main()
```

### Advanced Usage

*   **Nested Directories:** `method-types-ts-generator-alvamind` can scan nested directories to generate types for all your services.
*   **Custom Output Path:** You can specify a custom output path for your generated type definitions.
*  **Generics, Promises, Optionals:** The generator handles all of these types with ease.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works (Under the Hood)

The magic behind `method-types-ts-generator-alvamind` involves several steps:

1.  **Scanning:** It uses the TypeScript compiler API to scan the directory you provide and identifies all `.ts` files.
2.  **Parsing:** It parses each file to find class declarations and methods within those classes.
3.  **Extraction:** It extracts the name and parameter types for each method, including return types.
4.  **Type Generation:** It generates TypeScript interface that represents the structure of the scanned methods.
5. **Output:** Finally it writes the generated type definitions to a `.d.ts` file in the output location.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

*   **v1.0.0**: Initial release with basic functionality.
*   **v1.1.0**: Support for filtering classes/methods with decorators.
*   **v1.2.0**: Configurable naming patterns for generated interfaces.
*   **v1.3.0**: Support for comments and jsDoc in generated types.
*   **v1.4.0**: Watch mode, automatically regenerate types on file changes.
